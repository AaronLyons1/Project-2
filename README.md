# My Second Product

This project really tested me, it is now 4am before my submission date and have work tomorrow,
this project isn't my proudest product, but nonetheless, I have poured all my knowledge of JS into this 
project. My project has its majors downs and a couple ups, but the main concern is the score counter
isn't working, the code is there for it to work, but it doesn't I can't understand.

My planning on this project was slightly all over the place, but I eventually achieved what I was 
looking to achieve, I did get help from a YouTube video, but every other bit of code like JS and the majority of 
CSS is my own work

## Game results 
* When the user chooses an option, the screen changes with the option the player choose and the option the pc choose
* There is a change of symbols between transitions due to the first symbols not transferring to the transitioned page

## Testing
* I tested my site across different platforms, and it preformed perfectly across all
* I ran my HTML and CSS code through w3c validator and there were no errors or warnings in my code
* When I ran my JS code through a validator I received twenty Eight warnings but no errors, these errors from my understanding are from using an outdated version of code
* when I ran my website through lighthouse, I got back glowing reviews as follows

## bugs
* I would be lying if I said I didn't run into MAJOR mess-ups but somehow pulled myself out of the rough
* My biggest error was the transition after you click an option, I spent about 6 hours trying to figure it out but eventually got there.
* I did also have a problem with my submit button but aswel resolved that

#### unresolved problems
* The score board is the only problem that seems to be appearing, if I win my first round then it counts to the score but after that it won't count, but the pc score works perfectly.

# Deployment 
* This site was deployed using GitHubs built-in feature to allow the likes of me to upload pages for courses as such
* My site was uploaded at 3am, Thursday the 3rd of March 2022
